# Simon Game

This project is a Simon Game.

You are presented with a random series of button presses.

Each time you input a series of button presses correctly, you see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

You hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when you personally press a button.

If you press the wrong button, you are notified that you have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind you of the pattern so you can try again.

You can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

If you want to restart, you can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

You can play in strict mode where if you get a button press wrong, it notifies you that you have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

You can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. You are notified of your victory, then the game starts over.
